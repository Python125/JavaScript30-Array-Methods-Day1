This project focused on deepening my understanding of JavaScript array methods. By working through a tutorial from Wes Bos' JavaScript30 series, I had the opportunity to experiment with various array manipulations. Through this hands-on experience, I solidified my grasp of array methods and their applications in practical coding scenarios.
